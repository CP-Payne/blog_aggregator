This endpoint allows for the creation of a new user in the system.

## Request

`POST /v1/users`

### Headers

```request
Content-Type: application/json
```
- Indicates that the body of the request is JSON.

### Body Parameters

- `name`: A string containing the name of the user to be created.


### Example Request Body

```json
{
	 "name": "John Doe"
}
```

## Response

### Success Response

- **Code**: `201 CREATED`
- **Content**: JSON object containing the newly created user's details, including the API key generated by the server

### Example Success Response

```json
{   
	"id": "uuid-here",
	"name": "John Doe",
	"created_at": "timestamp-here",
	"updated_at": "timestamp-here",
	"apikey": "apikey-here"
}
```

The `id` is a unique identifier for the user, the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are timestamps of when the user was created and last updated, and the `apikey` is a string used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.


### Error Responses

    - **Code**: `400 BAD REQUEST`
    - **Content**: `{"error": "Couldn't decode parameters"}`

## Examples

### Create a New User

To create a new user account, you would make the following request:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/v1/users' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"name": "John Doe"}'
```



## Notes

- The `name` field is required to create a new user and must be a string.
- The response includes a generated `apikey` which should be stored securely and used for authenticating the user in subsequent requests.
- If the JSON body is not properly formatted or is missing required fields, the server will respond with a `400 BAD REQUEST`.
